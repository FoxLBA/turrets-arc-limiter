In Factorio 2.0, turrets collision box can be at an angle of 45°, which is why turrets larger than 2x2 have a different placing shape when oriented diagonally.
To position such turrets diagonally, take it in your hand, rotate 1 time and place it. Turret selection box should be at an angle of 45°. After limiting the arc of fire, you will be able to rotate the turret by 90°.
